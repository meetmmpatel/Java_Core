Collection Framework:

    1. Hold more the one variable or object (Array with resizable )
    2. it's data structure

    Interface Collection: (Only store the data in list format)
        1. Set interface:  will not allow duplicate..
        2. List interface: Will allow all the value including duplicate and null
        3. Queue interface: First In First out (FIFO and LIFO)

           List: ArrayList, LinkedList and Vector
           Set: HashSet, LinkedHashSet and TreeSet
           Queue: Queue, priority queue and stack

          List<DataType> name = new ArrayList<>();
          1. DataType can only be class.

    Map Interface: (can only store the data in key,value format)
          1. Hash Map
          2. Tree Map
          3. Hash Table

          Map<Integer, String> refname = new HashMap<>();

          HashMap: it makes no guarantees concerning the order of iteration

          TreeMap: It stores its elements in a red-black tree, orders
                   its elements based on their values; it is substantially
                   slower than HashMap.

          LinkedHashMap: It orders its elements based on the order
                  in which they were inserted into the set (insertion-order).

                  It stores key-value pairs similar to HashMap.
                  It contains only unique keys. Duplicate keys are not allowed.
                  It may have one null key and multiple null values.
                  It maintains the order of K,V pairs inserted to it
                  by adding elements to internally managed doubly-linked list.
